# Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
Create a pseudoQueue class that takes in a stack. and simulate a queue using two stacks.
Implement enqueue() and dequeue() using stacks.

## Challenge
Figure out a way to simulate queues while only using stacks, and there pop() peak() push() methods, which we achieved by popping of each item in the stack which allowed us to essentially iertate the stack and manipulate it thow we needed.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our approach is a brute force solution that is O(2n) efficiency which we could possibly improve to O(n) by adding an if statement inside the while loop.  Our space efficiency is also O(2n) due to copying the entire stack.
