# kth from the end of a Linked List
The getValue function takes in a number (k) and returns the value located at length - k.


## Challenge
The challenge was to determine the length of the list since that isn't already built into the list, which we did by iterating over the list and counting each node.

## Approach & Efficiency
the approach is was to iterate twice over the list resulting in worst case time of O(2n). The space required is O(1).
