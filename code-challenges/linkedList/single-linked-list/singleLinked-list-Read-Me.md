# Linked List Insertions
To create three functions append which appends a value to the end of the LL, insert before which finds a value in the LL and inserts a new value before that value, and insert after which finds a value in the array and inserts after the valus.

## Challenge
To insert and append to the LL without breaking it, and to write tests to verify the functions work.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach was to iterate the list node by node for each function which resulted in O(n) efficiency and for insertion we only had to make one node so that would be O(1).
