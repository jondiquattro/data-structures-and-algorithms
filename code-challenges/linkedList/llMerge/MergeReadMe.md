# Merge two Linked Lists
This function takes two linked lists and merges them together in place by changing the pointers for each node.

## Challenge
To merge the lists in zipper fashion (alternating between list nodes)

## Approach & Efficiency
We solved with O(n) time and O(1) space. By changing the pointers we only had to iterate the list one time.
