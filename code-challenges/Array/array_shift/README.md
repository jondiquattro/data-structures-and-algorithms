# Insert and shift middle index of array
This is a function that takes in an arrray and finds the middle, it then inserts the passed value into where the middle index is and shifts all indexes.

## Challenge
The challenge was to find a way to insert a new item in the middle of the array while keeping the same order.

## Approach & Efficiency
We decided to find the middle of the array and loop from mid to end and shift all of those elements.
space complexity is O(1)
time complexity is O(n) n being the size of the array.
