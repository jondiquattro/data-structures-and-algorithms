# FizzBuzz Tree
Take in a tree and deterimine if each node is divisable by either 3,5, or both, and return respective Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz.

## Challenge
Figure out how to traverse the tree and make calculations on each node.

## Approach & Efficiency
We approached the solution through a preorder traversal which calculated each node as it traversed with a time complexity of O(n) since we visit each node, and a space complexity of O(1);
