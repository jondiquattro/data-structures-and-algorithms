# Intersection of binary trees
Takes in two binary trees and reetunrs an array containing matching vales from each array.

## Challenge
The challenge was to find an efficient means of looking up each value in the trees to see if the other tree contains any of the values.

## Approach & Efficiency
time was o(n) since we are iterating each tree once o(n)+o(n) => 2(n) => O(n)
space was O(W) since we are iterating the trees breadth first.
