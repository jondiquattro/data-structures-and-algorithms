# Reverse an Array
This JavaScript file includes a method that takes in an array and returns a reversed array

## Challenge
Take an array and reverse it. For instance an array of [1,2,3,4] would then equal [4,3,2,1]

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach was to use a for loop and unshift each element to a new array which would reverse the array.
This Big O space would be O(n) since the the amount of space is in relation to the size of the array.
the Big O time would be O(n) since there is one operation on each index so the bigger the array, the bigger n.
